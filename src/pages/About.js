            Hi! üôÇ My name is <Link href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadiq-pasha/'>Sadiq</Link>, I am a full stack web developer.<br/>
            Planespotting is one my favourite hobbies and I am lucky to live in Southern California where we have some of the best planespotting in the world.<br/>
            Watching planes at LAX is fun, but it means juggling multiple websites to find information on arriving aircraft.<br/>
            I am always curious about aircraft flying in from all over the world, full of people with dreams, ambitions, fears; the pilots who fly these aircraft and of course; the fantastic aircraft themselves.<br/>
            I want to know all I can about the planes I watch. Where they come from, how long they have been flying, when they were made and by whom.<br/>
            I created this website as a way to put all that information together in one place.<br/>

            <Typography sx={{ color:'#FFFFFF'}} variant='body1' m={2} component='h1'>
                As this is a portfolio website, following is the tech stack that it is built on:<br/>
                1Ô∏è‚É£ REACT as the front end  UI framework.<br/>
                2Ô∏è‚É£ MATERIAL UI for the reusable components and customisability.<br/>
                3Ô∏è‚É£ EXPRESS as the backend server.<br/>
                4Ô∏è‚É£ NODEJS as the backend runtime environment.<br/>
                5Ô∏è‚É£ AXIOS for fetching data from the server.<br/>
                6Ô∏è‚É£ MONGODB as the database for flight and airframe data.<br/>
                7Ô∏è‚É£ GITHUB fer version control.<br/>
                8Ô∏è‚É£ Various API services for fetching data.<br/>
                9Ô∏è‚É£ And so much more. . . <br/><br/>
                
                I also used some cool tricks like Request Throttling, Error Handling, Cron Scheduling and Rate Limiting to not overload the server.<br/><br/>

                If you use any part of this stack, I would love to work with you and learn more! Connect with me on <Link href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadiq-pasha/'>LinkedIn</Link>.

            Data is like gold on the internet. It is expensive to get data for real time information, and even more so when querying multiple services.<br/>
            As of now there is a limit of 15 aircraft per request.<br/>
            This can be changed in the future to make it more dynamic.<br/>
